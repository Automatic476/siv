The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken 100,000 American lives. As states attempt re-opening, it’s becoming more and more clear we face unprecedented challenges with safe and reliable voting.

Last minute election crises in Wisconsin. Six hour waiting lines in Georgia. 600,000 voters in Kentucky forced to share a single polling location. Dozens of other states with cancelled or postponed primaries.

Election officials and political advocates have rushed to provide safe alternatives. Especially Vote by Mail.

But we can do better. Despite vast demand, there's only modest discussion towards digital voting. Most [mainstream coverage](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/why-you-cant-just-vote-on-your-phone-during-the-pandemic) discourages it. Too many people have been led to believe that internet voting is impossibly insecure.

### **_We've designed this page to show what's now possible._**

For public voting systems, a risk-averse attitude is important. It's up to us all to defend the legitimacy of our citizen-led system of government.

With that said, there have been tremendous breakthroughs in technology & advanced cryptography.

Digital voting is now practical. We've learned this from experience. For the last four years, our organization has been piloting demos with thousands of citizens, from all different backgrounds, geographies, and worldviews. We've seen firsthand what's possible.

Digital voting can be drastically **_faster_** and **_more accessible_** for citizens.

On top of that, digital voting can offer **_more security_** and **_more privacy_** than our paper based systems, if done right. Don't simply take our word for it, this page exists to show exactly how.

The icing on the cake is that digital approaches can **_reduce costs_** for running elections.

There are caveats. We're committed to detailing them in full.

But on the whole, digital voting can offer a far better process for everyone involved. For citizens, for election officials, and for the many volunteers who make free & fair elections possible.

And like Vote by Mail, your jurisdiction can offer Secure Internet Voting as a _complement_ to existing approaches. An addition, not a replacement. Anyone who prefers traditional methods can stick with them.

### **The number one challenge is a lack of widespread awareness.**

That's what [secureinternetvoting.org](https://secureinternetvoting.org) is for.

### SIV design goals:

1. Widely accessible from **any smartphone or desktop**. No installs necessary, just click a link.
2. **Quick** process from beginning to end.
3. You can **personally verify** that your vote counted.
4. **Provable anonymity**: _No one_, not even election administrators, can see how you voted.
5. **Auditable voter registration**: Only legitimate voters can vote, and only once. Everyone can see _who_ voted, but not _how_ anyone votes.

This work is built upon decades of research and hard work by uncountable contributors, in academia, industry, and the public sector.

And it’s ready to be used right now, if only your elected officials will allow it.

We offer this in a collaborative spirit, and appreciate all questions, feedback, and suggestions.

The more people talking about this, and who know this is now possible, the better.

### Thank you
