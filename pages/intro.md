# SIV: Secure Internet Voting

## Fast — Private — Verifiable

### Welcome.

It is nearly the end of June 2020. We are now months into a pandemic, which has already taken over 100,000 lives in the US alone.

One consequence has been widespread issues with reliable voting. Last minute election crises in Wisconsin. Six hour waiting lines in Georgia. 600,000 voters in Kentucky forced to share a single polling location. Dozens of other states with cancelled or postponed primaries.

Election officials and political advocates have rushed to provide safe alternatives. Especially Vote by Mail. This is encouraging.

But we can do better. Despite vast demand, there's only modest discussion towards digital voting. Most [mainstream coverage](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/why-you-cant-just-vote-on-your-phone-during-the-pandemic) discourages it. Too many people have been led to believe that internet voting is impossibly insecure.

### **_We've designed this page to show what's now possible._**

For public voting systems, a risk-averse attitude is important. It's up to us all to defend the legitimacy of our citizen-led system of government.

With that said, there have been tremendous breakthroughs in technology & advanced cryptography.

Digital voting is now practical. We've learned this from experience. For the last four years, our organization has been piloting demos with thousands of citizens, from all different backgrounds, geographies, and worldviews. We've seen firsthand what's possible.

Digital voting can be drastically **_faster_** and **_more accessible_** for citizens.

On top of that, digital voting _can_ offer **_more security_** and **_more privacy_** than our paper based systems. Don't simply take our word for it, this page exists to show exactly how.

The icing on the cake is that digital approaches can even **_reduce costs_** for running elections.

There are caveats. We're committed to detailing them in full.

But on the whole, digital voting can offer a far better process for everyone involved. For citizens, for election officials, and for the many volunteers who make free & fair elections possible.

And like Vote by Mail, your jurisdiction can offer Secure Internet Voting as a _complement_ to existing approaches. An addition, not a replacement. Anyone who prefers traditional methods can stick with them.

### **The number one challenge is a lack of widespread awareness.**

That's what [secureinternetvoting.org](https://secureinternetvoting.org) is for.

### Our design goals:

1. **Easy** to use.
2. Widely accessible from **any smartphone or desktop**.
3. **Quick** process from beginning to end.
4. Implements & explains **Voter Verifiability**. You can _personally_ audit that your vote was recorded & tallied correctly.
5. Implements & explains **Vote Privacy**. _No one_, not even the election administrator, can see how you voted. This is _provable anonymity_, based on math, which we strive to explain as clearly as possible.
6. Enforces an **auditable Voter Registration** process. Only legitimate voters can vote, and only once. Everyone can see _who_ voted, but not _how_ anyone voted.

This work is built upon decades of research and hard work by uncountable contributors, in academia, industry, and the public sector.

We offer this in a collaborative spirit, and appreciate all questions, feedback, and suggestions.

The more people talking about this, and who know this is now possible, the better.

### Thank you
