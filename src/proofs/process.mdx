## Work backwards from Vote Totals:

<Totals />

- [ ] Include Vote Totals

1. Vote totals are the sums of each unique option from the Decrypted Votes table.

These sums are being automatically recounted in every visitor's browser.

Anyone can verify these numbers themselves by hand or spreadsheet.

2. Combine the tracking number and each vote column like this: [tracking]:[vote].

3. Encode the alphanumeric votes into an integer.

4. The decrypted votes are the Lagrangian Interpolations of the Partial Decryptions provided by the Trustees.

- [ ] Show Partial Decryption data

- [ ] Provide code to implement the Lagrangian Interpolation formula
