<Totals proofsPage />

## Working backwards from the Vote Totals...

1. Vote totals are the sums of each unique option from the Decrypted Votes table.

<DecryptedVotes proofsPage />

You can verify these numbers yourself by hand or spreadsheet.

2. Combine the verification # and each vote column like this: [verification]:[vote].

<RecombinedTable />

3. Encode the alphanumeric votes into integers.

<EncodedsTable />

4. The decrypted votes are the Lagrangian Interpolations of the Partial Decryptions provided by the Trustees.

<Partials />

5. Each Partial can be verified using their individual ZK Proofs, against the final shuffled list, and the trustee's public commitments.
