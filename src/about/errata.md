## SIV Research Errata

### Neff 2001:
- pg 4, eq 14: Product of y_i's should say from `i = 1`, not `i - 1`.

### Neff 2004:
- pg 17, eq 49: `b_j` and `c_i` positions look accidentally swapped, if we want those equations to match definition of `r_i` and `s_i`.

- pg 17, eq 49: Neff writes out two equations, but maybe not necessary? Just a single one is enough to re-derive eq 48.

- pg 18, eq 50, and 51: Missing `\gamma` factor on right side of both equations to match eq 48.

- pg 5, Lemma 4: Unclear result. Why `2/q`? Why not `1/q`?
